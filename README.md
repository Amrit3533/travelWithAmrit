### Local Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    cd travelwith_amrit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env` and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET"

    * Mapbox access token can be generated from your Mapbox account.
    * `SESSION_SECRET` should be a long, random string for session security.

    You can start the server using one of the following commands:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    # or
    nodemon app.js
    # or simply (if nodemon is globally installed)
    nodemon
    ```
    The application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port is configured).
